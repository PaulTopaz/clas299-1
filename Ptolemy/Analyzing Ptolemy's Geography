## Analyzing Ptolemy's Geography
##### *Paul Topazio & Kassandra Merino*
- When analyzing Ptolemy's geographic data in class, it was clear that something was off with his mapping measurements compared to modern cartography.  Many of the original points are arranged in a way which clearly illustrate the defined shapes of Greece, Italy and other countries in the Mediterranean (and even countries further to the south and east).  Plotting these points on a modern map however rendered a rather blown out representation of these countries, due to an inadequate scaling of said points.  To compensate for the incorrect scale, we set out to correctly adjust for the latitude and longitude of Ptolemy's original points and correctly compute the offset using Scala in our Jupyter notebooks.
