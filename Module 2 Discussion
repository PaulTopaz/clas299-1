### Module 2 Brief Discussion - Paul Topazio & Kassandra Merino Muniz
Looking at the exported map holding the coordinates of painted-pottery find spots from last year, and from the 2020 delimited text files, a number of patterns began to emerge.  Setting up our analysis, we first began by adding last years delimited text file into QGIS, delineating a series of points on a layer above the world map we had previously placed there.  This text file translated easily into coordinates which appeared throughout the Mediterranean.  However, the number of find-spots proved to be quite large, and only offered a rather general overview as to where unique painted pottery was found. Therefore, before making any sort of analysis, we broke down our view of the map into multiple layers, in order to get a better perspective on where and when pieces were made, pinpointing the location and time period of these painted works in the ancient world. We first decided to break down and sort the coordinates of points from last year’s list of four unique painters, into two groups as we had done in class: the “archaic” painters, and the classical painters.  For reference, “archaic” findspots are composed of the painters Kleitias and Sophilos, while the classical group is made up of the works of Achilles and Tyszkiewicz Painter.  Now that we had broken down the delimited text file from last year into two separate parts, we now had a total of three separate layers to work with.  The first layer - all of last years findings - illustrated a high frequency of painted pieces stretching down the west coast of Italy, a number of find-spots around Athens in Greece, one in modern day Turkey, Rhodes, Cyprus, and one close to Alexandria in Egypt.  The second layer, entitled “Archaic Painters” isolates the findspots of painted pottery by Kleitias and Sophilos, who both worked during 580-560 BCE.  With this layer isolated from the full collection of coordinates, its apparent that the works of the Archaic Painters were more densely located in Greece.  The third layer, entitled “Classical Painters” isolates the findspots of painted pottery by Achilles and Tyszkiewicz who both worked during mid-5th century.  With this layer isolated again from the full collection of coordinates, and from the Archaic Painters layer, its apparent that the works of the Classical Painters were more evenly spread throughout Italy than the rest of the Mediterranain.  With this being said however, although a high number of unique findspots may appear throughout Italy, it doesn’t mean more pottery can be found there.  With only four findspots in Greece, there still remains about the same number of painted pottery found in these locations as there were from the era of the Archaic Painters.  This means as time progressed, the number of pots in Greece didn’t necessarily diminish, but the distribution of these pots greatly increased throughout the world - to parts like Italy - indicating higher demand for these pots in different parts of the world.  After this analysis, our group loaded a new layer onto the exported map - the collective delimited data findings of this year’s archaeology class.  With this layer we found that the pattern of high distribution in Italy increased as time progressed, while the pottery in Greece could still be seen in high numbers, but in fewer unique locations.
